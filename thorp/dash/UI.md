# Thorp dashboard: UI and UX standards

The dashboard is one page (`index.html`), served by `server.py`. These rules keep it reading as one
system. When a change needs something not covered here, add the rule here in the same change.

## Tokens

Every colour, radius and font size comes from a token on `:root`. No hex value or pixel font size
is written anywhere else in the CSS, and the charts read the same tokens (`C` and `PALETTE` in the
script are filled from the CSS, not typed in again).

| token | use |
|---|---|
| `--bg` | the page |
| `--panel` | panels, cards, the header's active tab |
| `--raise` | hover and popover surfaces, one step above a panel |
| `--line` | every border and rule |
| `--text`, `--muted` | body text; labels, notes, secondary numbers |
| `--accent` | the one highlight: active tab, selected row, sort arrow, card hover, section titles |
| `--good`, `--bad`, `--blue` | status only (finished / failed / running), never decoration |
| `--fs-xs` 11 · `--fs-sm` 12 · `--fs-md` 13 · `--fs-base` 14 · `--fs-lg` 16 · `--fs-xl` 18 · `--fs-2xl` 22 | the only font sizes (2xl is for headline numbers) |
| `--r-sm` 6 · `--r-md` 8 · `--r-pill` 10 | controls; panels, cards and popovers; pills |
| `--track`, `--c5`…`--c12` | a chart's background trace; the chart palette after blue, accent, good, bad |

Numbers sit in `tabular-nums` everywhere (set on `body`).

## Layout

- A tab is a `.section`: an `h1` with the question it answers in `.q`, then panels.
- A panel is `section.panel` with an `h2` title and an optional `.note` saying how to read it.
- Two or three panels side by side use `.row` / `.row3`; both fall back to one column on narrow screens.
- Spacing comes from the grid gaps (16px). One-off margins use `.mt` (8px), not `style=""`.
  Inline styles are only for values computed at run time (a chart height, the reader's page width).

## Components

Each of these exists once. Use it instead of styling a new one.

- **DataTable** (script, top): every `<table>` sorts by clicking a header, keeps its sort through
  the 5 s redraw, and keeps footer rows (one `colspan` cell) at the bottom. `data-sort="…"` on a
  cell sorts by a hidden value; `data-nosort` on a table opts out.
  A table whose rows open something gets the class `clickable`: its rows then show a hover, take
  keyboard focus, and open on Enter or Space.
- **Pill** (`.pill`): a small rounded label. Colour variants `.good`, `.bad`, `.blue`, `.accent`,
  and `.solid` for a filled one. Run status uses `.pill.running / .finished / .failed`.
  (`.badge` is an alias kept for existing markup.)
- **Button** (`button`, `.btn`): one look for every button on the dark page; `.on` marks the
  selected one in a group (`.booktabs`).
- **Field** (`select`, `input`): one look for every field.
- **Info popover** (`info(key)` in the script → `ⓘ`): the help for a metric (what it is, which way
  is better, how it is measured). Every metric's first appearance in a heading carries one.
- **Empty state** (`.empty`, or `empty(id, msg)` for charts): says why nothing is there and what
  command fills it, e.g. `thorp eval RUN --evaluators curiosity`. Never a bare blank.
- **Book reader** (`#reader`): a book is read the way a Kindle Paperwhite shows one, after the
  Atlas essay reader in the monorepo (`packages/ui/apps/atlas/src/components/EssayReader.tsx`):
  paper, ink, a justified serif, pages or scroll, A−/A+, a quiet footer. It is the one place the
  page leaves the dark theme, on purpose.

## Interaction

- Anything clickable shows `cursor: pointer`, a hover state and a visible focus ring
  (`:focus-visible`, the accent colour). Anything clickable can be reached and used by keyboard.
- Escape closes whatever is on top (popover, reader). Arrow keys turn pages in the reader.
- State a reader would want back is kept in `localStorage` under `thorp.*`, wrapped in try/catch:
  table sorts live for the page's life; the reader's text size, mode and place in each book persist.
- The URL holds where you are: `?run=` for the run, `#tab` or `#rung-<size>` for the view. Clicking
  THORP goes home.

## Words

- Plain English in sentence case. Headings say what a panel shows; the `.note` says how to read it.
- Say which way is better for every metric (`lower is better`), in the popover or the heading.
- Units on every number that has one (`bpb`, `KB`, `min`). Missing values are `–`.
